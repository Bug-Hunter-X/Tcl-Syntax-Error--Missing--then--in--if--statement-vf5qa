# Tcl Syntax Error: Missing `then` in `if` statement

This repository demonstrates a common, subtle error in Tcl's `if` statement syntax.  The code appears to perform a simple conditional check, but it fails because the `then` keyword is missing.

The `bug.tcl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully following Tcl's syntax rules, especially within conditional statements.
